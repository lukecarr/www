        <p><strong>Hi there! &#128075;</strong></p>
        <p>My name&apos;s Luke! I&apos;m based in the UK, and I&apos;m currently working on <strong>API Security</strong> at <strong>Cloudflare</strong> as a <strong>Systems Engineer</strong>.</p>
        <p>As far as open source projects go, I enjoy working on anything and everything related to <strong>game development &#127918;</strong>, <strong>privacy &#128064;</strong>, and <strong>data analysis/engineering &#128451;</strong>.</p>
        <p>I currently spend most of time in <strong>Rust</strong> and <strong>TypeScript</strong>, and I take pride in writing code that&apos;s <strong>lightweight &#127811;</strong> and <strong>performant &#128170;</strong>!</p>
